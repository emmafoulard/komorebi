# komorebi
Komorebi is a minimal application, encouraging real-life social networking through small, short phone games. The application pairs the participants of the game based on geolocation, so that people taking the same bus/metro/ waiting station get involved in a gaming experience with an unknown, anonymous user. We bet on human curiosity that our users will be intrigued about the other person and will look around for their competitors: that is when the opportunity of smile exchange arises, when the two sights meet and two humans are momentarily connected. At the end of the game, the participants can also exchange in√©dit recommendations - music, books or restaurants- and receive their rewards in the form of points.
